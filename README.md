"# PizzPlace-angular" 

Create a prototype website for a pizza chain. The pizza chain has franchises in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, each with different names. The pizza chain serves three different specialty pizzas: cheese, veggie, and meat. Each franchise has a different name for each specialty pizza and different toppings – but veggie pizzas always have mushrooms and meat pizzas always have pepperoni.

A user must be able to select their city, then select a specialty pizza, and then view the list of toppings for the selected pizza. An online order form and/or any other features you'd like to add are optional.

The company is thinking of expanding in the future, so please give some consideration to how easy it would be to add additional franchises in the future.

The purpose of this exercise is primarily to show off your JavaScript skills, but we do encourage you to spice things up with some CSS. Please do not use any technologies other than HTML, CSS, and JS, but feel free to use any JS libraries or frameworks that you are familiar with. This is a good opportunity to show your resourcefulness and creativity.

Please DO NOT use any CSS frameworks (such as Bootstrap or Foundation) beyond a reset sheet, as they tend to significantly reduce the amount of CSS that you end up writing yourself. Usually that’s not a bad thing, but we want to see your CSS capabilities.
